  ### Summary
___
Our project is an automated cold-foam dispensing system designed to streamline a key step in specialty coffee preparation. The machine operates with minimal user inputâ€”requiring only the placement of a coffee cup on a sensor pad and occasional refilling of cream and syrup reservoirs. Once the cup is detected by an analog QRE1113 reflectance sensor, the system initiates a sequence that first dispenses syrup and cream through two 3.3V submersible pumps. Next, a stepper-motor-driven linear rail lowers a milk frother into the cup. A servo motor activates the frother, which prepares cold foam directly inside the cup. After frothing, the rail raises the frother back to its original position, and a second servo can perform a follow-up action, such as dispensing or finishing the foam layer. The system is designed for consistency, ease of use, and hands-free operation, demonstrating how automation can improve efficiency and reduce labor demands in beverage preparation.
